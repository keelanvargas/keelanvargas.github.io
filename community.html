						<p>This page highlights my involement in events within the GIS community including conference attendences, 
							presentations, and awards.</p>

						<h3>2025</h3>
						<h5>Etsy Page for Ski Resort Maps | September</h5>
						<p>In 2025, I began selling my series of ski resort maps that I have created using OpenSkiMap data in ArcGIS Pro and Canva. 
						These maps are also sold in Ohana, a shop in Steamboat Springs, Colorado that highlights local artists.
						</p>

						<h5>Freelance Cartography for Upcountry Steamboat | May</h5>
						<p>In the spring of 2025, I was commissioned to create a series of 4 maps for Upcountry Steamboat, a local shop that sells clothing and home goods. 
							These maps can be found on the Cartography page and feature a consistent design and cartographic style to depict four areas around Steamboat Springs, 
							Routt County, and the State of Colorado.  
						</p>

						<h3>2024</h3>
						<h5>Elevations Geospatial Summit | May </h5>
						<p>At this conference held by the GIS Colorado organization, I gave a presentation with colleagues on the resources
							that our team provides and updates to our future goals. We touched on our migration to an ArcGIS Enterprise 
							environment hosted in the AWS cloud, the statewide imagery program that we manage, and highlighted various 
							improvements in workflows using Python and FME. 
						</p>

						<h5>Esri Developer's Summit | March </h5>
						<p>I attended the Esri Developer Summit with two colleagues in March 2024. This was the first major conference I have been too and I had a great time learning about 
							resources from Esri and getting to talk to Esri developers about best practices for projects I was working on.  
						</p>

						<p>The <a href="https://geodata.colorado.gov/pages/gis-summit">2023 GIS Summit</a> was a one-day conference highlighting GIS at the State of Colorado that our team 
						organized and adminstered. I presented with a colleague on the updated resources that the OIT-GIS team has created and made available for both GIS professionals and 
						the general public.

						<h5>GIS Colorado Spring Meetup | May</h5>
						<p>I attended this quarterly meeting in Grand Junction, Colorado and presented with a colleague on the available OIT-GIS resources that our team had 
							recently published such as our new website, our new spatial data portal, and various training resources.

						<h3>2022</h3>	
						<h5>GIS in the Rockies | October </h5>
						<p>I attended this conference while I was working as an intern at the Colorado Department of Transportation. I presented with my boss on the 
							Right-of-Way project that I focused on during my time at CDOT. We covered the background of the project, the current workflows for data processing and creation, 
							and the future applications of this data.
