							environment hosted in the AWS cloud, the statewide imagery program that we manage, and highlighted various 
							improvements in workflows using Python and FME.

						<h5>Esri Developer's Summit | March </h5>
						<p>I attended the Esri Developer Summit with two colleagues in March 2024. This was the first major conference I have been too and I had a great time learning about 
							resources from Esri and getting to talk to Esri developers about best practices for projects I was working on.
