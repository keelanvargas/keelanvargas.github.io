								<h2>The Aspen Archives</h2>
								<h3>Lead GIS Research Assistant</h3>
								<h4>2021 - Present</h4>
								<p>During the past forty years sheep ranchers in Colorado and the Western U.S. have become reliant on the expertise and labor of indigenous
									 Peruvian Quechua herders participating in the US H-2A temporary agricultural worker visa program (Krögel, 2010). 
									 Echoes of these herders’ work in Routt County, Colorado remain in messages and symbols carved upon aspen trees 
									 located in the Medicine Bow-Routt National Forests. These carvings —known as arborglyphs—depict sheepherders’ 
									 experiences working on the open range and in high country forests, and serve as a blank slate for commentary about 
									 various topics such as religion, politics, or friendship. Research has been previously conducted on the significance
									  of sheepherders’ use of arborglyphs to inscribe names, dates, regional origins, and commentary on herders lives (Mallea-Olaetxe, 2010). 
									  Furthermore, the paths and routes frequented by herders have been studied and dubbed “Sheepscapes”. </p>

								<p>Dr. Alison Krögel is a professor in the Department of Spanish at the University of Denver where she teaches courses focused on 
									Quechua and Andean literatures and cultures. She has been studying arborglyphs and the anthropological narratives they illustrate 
									for over a decade and needed to add a spatial component to <a href="https://www.5280.com/aspen-archives-showcases-tree-carvings-left-by-sheepherders-in-colorados-high-country/">her research and exhibit</a></p>
								<p>In 2020, Mark Chapman, a citizen scientist and resident of nearby Steamboat Springs, contacted the U.S. Forest Service and 
									donated 180 photos of the glyphs that he has documented in the past thirty years. Digitizing and mapping Mr. Chapman’s 
									images was crucial to the exploration of the historical and cultural significance of these sheepherders in Routt County.</p>

								<p>I have worked as the Lead GIS coordinator on this project since 2021. To start, I created two datasets to represent locations of arborglyphs. 
									Part of the data exists as a polygon layer, digitized from areas where Mr. Chapman has documented arborglyphs on USGS Topo Quad maps in Routt County, CO. 
									The other part of the data is a point layer of exact locations, derived from coordinate information from the images that Dr. Krögel has documented herself.
									 Throughout the project, I have designed and built a geodatabase to store the locations of arborglyphs and their attributes, 
									 built a <a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/841b15430ce44650be8fd40f63eb84ce">web application to display the locations of glyphs</a> using the Esri Experience Builder platform,
									  and put together <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/collections/63bde6501e8f4feab6f261c68d27ce2a">the digital version of Dr. Krögel’s
									exhibit The Aspen Archives using Esri StoryMap Collections.</a></p>
